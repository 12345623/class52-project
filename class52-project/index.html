     <h1>What is Origami?</h1>
     <p>Origami is the art of paper folding, which is often associated with Japanese culture. 
     In modern usage, the word "origami" is used as an inclusive term for all folding practices, 
     regardless of their culture of origin. While some of the oldest pieces of origami have been 
     found in ancient China and its deepest roots are in ancient Japan, origami can make an impact 
     in today's education too. This art form engages students and sneakily enhances their skills, 
     including improved spatial perception and logical and sequential thinking. Many studies assert 
     that origami was invented by the Japanese about a thousand years ago, but its roots may well be 
     in China. It is also highly probable that the process of folding was applied to other materials 
     before paper was invented, so the origins of recreational folding may lie with cloth or leather.</p>

     <p>Here is a website that goes into further details about origami and its origins</p>

     <h4>Some Camel Fun Facts</h4>
     <p>There are two types of camels: One humped or “dromedary” camels and two humped Bactrian camels.</p>
      <p>Camels have three sets of eyelids and two rows of eyelashes to keep sand out of their eyes.</p>
      <p>Camels have thick lips which let them forage for thorny plants other animals can’t eat.</p>
      <p>Camels can completely shut their nostrils during sandstorms.</p>
      <p>Thanks to thick pads of skin on their chest and knees, camels can comfortably sit in very hot sand.</p>

      <h4>Some Chameleon Fun Facts</h4>
      <p>Chameleons are a very unique branch of the lizard group of reptiles.</p>
       <p>There are around 160 species of chameleons.</p>
       <p>Chameleons live in warm varied habitats from rainforests through to deserts.</p>
       <p>Almost half of the world's chameleon species are native to Madagascar, they are 
         also found in Africa, and southern Europe to as far as Sri Lanka in Asia and have 
         been introduced to Hawaii, California and Florida.</p>
       <p>Chameleon change color for camouflage but this is not always the main reason. 
         Some show darker colors when angry, or when trying to scare others. Males show 
         light multi-colored patterns when vying for female attention. Desert varieties 
         change to black when its cooler to absorb heat, then a light grey to reflect heat.</p>

      <h4>Some Cicada Fun Facts</h4>
      <p>Cicadas can survive a huge fall as babies, or nymphs. They are about the size of a grain of rice when they drop from a tree branch to the ground and start digging.</p>
       <p>The loud whirring or buzzing sound you hear is an all-male cicada chorus. (Females make a much quieter sound by flicking their wings.) 
         Cicadas don’t sing at night, so don’t blame them if you can’t sleep.</p>
       <p>Most have red-orange eyes. But occasionally cicadas have blue, white or grayish eyes. Keep on the lookout.</p>
       <p>Females may be attracted to the sound of motors. So you get to watch your dad, mom or older sibling get swarmed while they’re using the lawn mower or power tools.</p>
       <p>Their short adult life is not unusual for bugs. The adult stage for many insects is only for finding a mate or moving to a new location.</p>

      <p>Giant pandas are good at climbing trees and can also swim.</p>
       <p>Pandas go from pink to white and black (or brown).</p>
       <p>As about all a panda does all day is eat and sleep.</p>
       <p>An adult can eat 12–38 kilos of bamboo per day!</p>
       <p>Pandas have carnivorous teeth, but they eat bamboo and fruit.</p>

     <div class="facts">
      <h4>Some Pigeon Fun Facts</h4>
      <p>Pigeons are highly sociable animals. They will often be seen in flocks of 20-30 birds.</p>
       <p>Pigeons mate for life, and tend to raise two chicks at the same time.</p>
       <p>Pigeons have excellent hearing abilities. They can detect sounds at far lower frequencies than humans are able to, and can thus hear distant storms and volcanoes.</p>
       <p>Despite the social perception as dirty and disease-ridden, pigeons are actually very clean animals and there is very little evidence to suggest that they are 
         significant transmitters of disease.</p>
       <p>Pigeons can fly at altitudes up to and beyond 6000 feet, and at an average speed of 77.6 mph. The fastest recorded speed is 92.5 mph.</p>

      <h4>Some Teddy Bear Fun Facts</h4>
      <p>The teddy was named after President Theodore Roosevelt, after he refused to shoot a bear during a 1902 hunting trip.</p>
       <p>The largest collection of teddies ever auctioned belonged to American multi-million dollar investment scammer Paul Greenwood. 
         His collection of 1,300 bears was auctioned at Christie’s for £1.1million.</p>
       <p>They aren’t just for children – 40 per cent of teddy sales are for adults, and a quarter of us still has our childhood companion. </p>
       <p>A teddy has been into space! Magellan T Bear boarded Space Shuttle Discovery in 1995 as part of a school project. </p>
       <p>Winnie the Pooh was based on a real bear</p>
